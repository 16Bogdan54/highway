<h1>Get started</h1>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The elements required for Highway are the <code>data-router-wrapper</code> and the <code>data-router-view</code>. Highway cannot work without those elements. The <code>data-router-view</code> that will contain the content of a page should always be a child of the <code>data-router-wrapper</code>. Highway will look for this element in pages to update the content on navigation.</p>
<pre>
<code class="html">&lt;!-- File: index.html --&gt;
&lt;!-- [...] --&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!-- [...] --&gt;
  &lt;main data-router-wrapper&gt;
    &lt;article data-router-view="name"&gt;
      &lt;!-- [...] --&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;!-- [...] --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h2 id="renderers">Renderers</h2>
<p>A renderer is a script for each view that contains all the Javascript we need for each one of them. It can be shared by multiple views if we want. A default renderer called <strong>Highway.Renderer</strong> can be extended to create our custom ones and it'll be used by default if a given view has no custom renderer attached to it.</p>
<p>A renderer comes with some built-in methods to let us call our scripts at different key moment during the navigation process. These built-in methods are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>onEnter</strong>: This method is called when the <strong>data-router-view</strong> is added to the DOM.</li>
    <li><strong>onLeave</strong>: This method is called when the transition to hide the <strong>data-router-view</strong> starts.</li>
    <li><strong>onEnterCompleted</strong>: This method is called when the transition to show the <strong>data-router-view</strong> is over.</li>
    <li><strong>onLeaveCompleted</strong>: This method is called when the <strong>data-router-view</strong> is removed from the DOM.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our custom renderer we also have access to some useful variables:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>this.view</strong>: The <strong>[data-router-view]</strong> of the view the renderer is attached to.</li>
    <li><strong>this.properties</strong>: All the properties we can get of our renderer (page, view, slug, transition,...).</li>
</ul>

<p>Long story short, let see what a custom renderer look like:</p>
{% include _snippets/renderer.html %}

<h2 id="transitions">Transitions</h2>
<p>OK so we know more about renderers but we are sad because there are no transitions between our views... Let now see how to create them!</p>
<p>Transitions in <strong>Highway</strong> are pretty simple. A default transition called <strong>Highway.Transition</strong> can be extended to create our custom ones. Once we've extended the <strong>Highway.Transition</strong> we have access to those essential methods:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>in</strong>: The method that should contain the transition to show a <strong>data-router-view</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>out</strong>: The method that should contain the transition to hide a <strong>data-router-view</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of those methods get two parameters we can name the way we want.<br> Here are some good defaults:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>view</strong>: The <strong>data-router-view</strong> to show or hide.</li>
    <li><strong>done</strong>: The required callback method <strong>we have to call</strong> once each of the transitions is over.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let now see what a custom transition looks like:</p>
{% include _snippets/transition.html %}

<h2 id="core">Core</h2>
<p>We should now have our custom renderers and transitions, it's time to attach everything to the right views and to <strong>Highway</strong>. To do so we have to call <strong>Highway.Core</strong> where we can attach everything we created.</p>
<p>Remember the <strong>data-router-view</strong> we added to our view? We named it and its name will now be used to attach it to our custom renderer and transition.</p>
<p>This is a reminder of our HTML structure so far:</p>
{% include _snippets/structure.html %}

<p>Now let's call <strong>Highway.Core</strong> and do some magic:</p>
{% include _snippets/core.html %}

<p>Now we attached our custom renderer and transition to our view, all scripts contained in the custom renderer will be called everytime the view is displayed and the transition will be called everytime we leave or access the view.</p>
<p>We might want to use the same transition for all the views across our website. This is possible by adding a <strong>default</strong> key to our transitions list in the <strong>Highway.Core</strong> options. When we do so, for each view, <strong>Highway</strong> will look for a transition attached to our <strong>data-router-view</strong> name and fallback to the default one if none is found.</p>
{% include _snippets/core-default.html %}

<p>That's it ! We now have <strong>Highway</strong> setup and ready to work. We can repeat those steps for each view of our website and we'll have beautiful transitions between them.</p>
<p>We can go further an take a look at the <a href="./api.html">API</a> of <strong>Highway</strong>.</p>
