<h1>Get started</h1>
<h2 id="structure">HTML Structure</h2>
<p>The elements required for Highway are the <code>data-router-wrapper</code> and the <code>data-router-view</code>. Highway cannot work without those elements. The <code>data-router-view</code> that will contain the content of a page should always be a child of the <code>data-router-wrapper</code>.</p>
<p>Highway will look for the <code>data-router-view</code> in pages to update the content but everything that is outside the <code>data-router-wrapper</code> is considered as being shared between pages and will stay the same on navigation.</p>
<pre>
<code class="html">&lt;!-- File: index.html --&gt;
&lt;!-- [...] --&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!-- [...] --&gt;
  &lt;main data-router-wrapper&gt;
    &lt;article data-router-view="name"&gt;
      &lt;!-- [...] --&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;!-- [...] --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h2 id="renderers">Renderers</h2>
<p>The renderers work like capsules where all the Javascript related to a single page is put. Each page can have its custom renderer which will extend the built-in and default <code>Highway.Renderer</code>. A page that doesn't need specific Javascript doesn't need a renderer as well so the built-in <code>Highway.Renderer</code> will be used instead.</p>
<p>The Javascript inside a renderer will be run everytime the page it's related to is either displayed or hidden on navigation. A number of hooks/methods are available to structure the renderer and call specific pieces of Javascript at key moments on navigation.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>onEnter</code>: This method is run when the <code>data-router-view</code> is added to the DOM Tree.</li>
    <li><code>onLeave</code>: This method is run when the transition to hide the <code>data-router-view</code> runs.</li>
    <li><code>onEnterCompleted</code>: This method is run when the transition to display the <code>data-router-view</code> is done.</li>
    <li><code>onLeaveCompleted</code>: This method is run when the <code>data-router-view</code> is removed from the DOM Tree.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, built-in variables are available through the extension of the <code>Highway.Renderer</code>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>this.wrap</code>: The <code>data-router-wrapper</code> of the page the renderer is related to.</li>
    <li><code>this.properties</code>: A set of properties related to the renderer (page, view, slug, transition,...).</li>
</ul>

<pre>
<code class="js">// File: custom-renderer.js
// Import Highway
import Highway from '@dogstudio/highway';

class CustomRenderer extends Highway.Renderer {
  // Hooks/methods
  onEnter() { [...] }
  onLeave() { [...] }
  onEnterCompleted() { [...] }
  onLeaveCompleted() { [...] }
}

// Don`t forget to export your renderer
export default CustomRenderer;
</code>
</pre>

<h2 id="transitions">Transitions</h2>
<p>The transitions are the managers of the animations to display or hide a page. Each page can have its custom transition which will extend the built-in and default <code>Highway.Transition</code>. A page that doesn't have a transition related to it won't be animated.</p>
<p>The Javascript inside a transition will be run everytime a page it's related to is either displayed or hidden on navigation. Two hooks/methods are available to manage which animations should be run to display a page and which one should be run to hide a page.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>in</code>: This method should contain the animation to display a <code>data-router-view</code>.</li>
    <li><code>out</code>: This method should contain the animation to hide a <code>data-router-view</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parameters can be used with these hooks/methods to animate pages and run everything smoothly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>view</code>: The <code>data-router-view</code> to display or hide.</li>
    <li><code>done</code>: The required callback method that <strong>has to be called</strong> once the animation is done.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
<code class="js">// File: custom-transition.js
// Import Highway
import Highway from '@dogstudio/highway';

class CustomTransition extends Highway.Transition {
  // Built-in methods
  in(view, done) {
    // [...]
  }

  out(view, done) {
    // [...]
  }
}

// Don`t forget to export your transition
export default CustomTransition;
</code>
</pre>

<h2 id="core">Core</h2>
<p>We should now have our custom renderers and transitions, it's time to attach everything to the right views and to <strong>Highway</strong>. To do so we have to call <strong>Highway.Core</strong> where we can attach everything we created.</p>
<p>Remember the <strong>data-router-view</strong> we added to our view? We named it and its name will now be used to attach it to our custom renderer and transition.</p>
<p>This is a reminder of our HTML structure so far:</p>
{% include _snippets/structure.html %}

<p>Now let's call <strong>Highway.Core</strong> and do some magic:</p>
{% include _snippets/core.html %}

<p>Now we attached our custom renderer and transition to our view, all scripts contained in the custom renderer will be called everytime the view is displayed and the transition will be called everytime we leave or access the view.</p>
<p>We might want to use the same transition for all the views across our website. This is possible by adding a <strong>default</strong> key to our transitions list in the <strong>Highway.Core</strong> options. When we do so, for each view, <strong>Highway</strong> will look for a transition attached to our <strong>data-router-view</strong> name and fallback to the default one if none is found.</p>
{% include _snippets/core-default.html %}

<p>That's it ! We now have <strong>Highway</strong> setup and ready to work. We can repeat those steps for each view of our website and we'll have beautiful transitions between them.</p>
<p>We can go further an take a look at the <a href="./api.html">API</a> of <strong>Highway</strong>.</p>
