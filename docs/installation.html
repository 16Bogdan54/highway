<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>Package</h2>
<h3>Install with YARN:</h3>
{% include _snippets/yarn.html %}

<h3>Install with NPM:</h3>
{% include _snippets/npm.html %}

<h2>Easy Usage</h2>
<p>Highway's package contains a <code>built</code> folder with the ready-to-use <strong>ES5 version</strong> of Highway. The ES6 version of Highway has been compiled into this ES5 version with an optimized <a href="#" target="_blank">configuration</a> we defined so developers don't need to bother with the compilation process.</p>
<p>Once the package is installed, Highway can be imported in Javascript with the <code>import</code> keyword to have access to <code>Highway.Core</code>, <code>Highway.Renderer</code> and <code>Highway.Transition</code> which are the ready-to-use classes that can be extended.</p>
{% include _snippets/import.html %}
