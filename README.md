**Highway** is a *modern*, *flexible* and *lightweight* library that will let you create **AJAX navigations** with beautiful **transitions** on your websites. It's been a while we were trying to build this kind of library to fits our needs at [**Dogstudio**](https://www.dogstudio.co) and that hopefully will fit yours now we're releasing it!

## Installation

You can install Highway the way you want between these two methods:

**With YARN:**
```
yarn add @dogstudio/highway
```

**With NPM:**
```
npm install --save @dogstudio/highway
```

## Usage

Now you have installed Highway it's time to dive into how you can now use it... And you know what? It's pretty simple.  
First let's *import* Highway:

```javascript
import Highway from '@dogstudio/highway';
```
or *require* it if you prefer:
```javascript
const Highway = require('@dogstudio/highway');
```
Now Highway is available you need to create an instance of `Highway.Core` and give it your [**renderers**]() and [**transitions**]().
```javascript
const H = new Highway.Core({
  renderers: {
    [...]
  },
  transitions: {
    [...]
  }
});
```
**And voil√†**!  
You are now ready to create some beautiful and creative transitions between your pages.
